# Brightness Control Using Gesture
A python program that uses OpenCv and mediapipe to see handgesture and accordingly set the Brightness of the system from a range of 0-100



I have used a HandTrackingModule that tracks all points on the hand as described in Mediapipe.
You can set draw values to false if you want in the function call.
You can call the get_label function from the handtrackingmodule if you want to get if The Hand is a Left hand or a Right Hand.
